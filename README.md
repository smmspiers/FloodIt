# FloodIt

A simple game which I did as a project as part of my degree. 

## What is the Game?
There is a grid of randomly arranged colours red, green, blue, yellow, magenta and cyan. The objective is to flood the entire grid of the one colour in the lest amount of turns possible.

## How to Run?
Enter the following:
```
ruby FloodIt.rb
```

## How to play?
Use the keys of the iniitials of the colours to change the colour of the first square, and any neighbouring squares of the same colour.

## What does the game look like?
